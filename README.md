# Fruit-And-Veg-Web-APP

In the this Fun Exercise we had to create a Simple CRUD Website.
I Had to design a fruit and veg Web Application that would be used by a Client to take Orders From Customers Via Phone.
A goal in mind when making this application was to try and make it as intuitive as possible.

The Client can:

• Create an Order for a selected customer.

• Add to the Product Inventory and also edit Products and their avalabilty.

• Add Customers to the Database And edit their details

• Edit Orders including The date.

• Search By Date.
